"""
Shared DNS-AID FQDN parsing.

The discoverer and the telemetry/otel layers both need to recognise the
three FQDN shapes that have ever been published under DNS-AID and pull
out the agent identity from each. Keeping a single parser here prevents
the two implementations from drifting — earlier each module had its
own, which had already diverged on strictness (one accepted the walkable
shape with an empty domain suffix, the other didn't).

Shapes recognised:

1. **Legacy draft-01** ``_{name}._{protocol}._agents.{domain}`` — the
   pre-flat shape; ``name`` and ``protocol`` both carry leading
   underscores. Strictly validated: rejects single-underscore-prefixed
   strings like ``_booking.mcp._agents.foo.com`` where only the first
   label is underscored, since that's neither legitimate -01 nor a
   correct walkable record.
2. **Walkable AliasMode draft-02** ``{name}._agents.{domain}`` — the
   optional walkable enumeration handle. Protocol is unknown from the
   FQDN alone (it now lives in the SVCB ``bap`` / ``alpn`` SvcParams),
   so ``protocol`` is returned as ``None``.
3. **Flat primary owner draft-02** ``{name}.{domain}`` — the canonical
   -02 shape, valid as an x.509 SAN dNSName. Protocol again ``None``.

Callers needing only a subset of the returned tuple should project from
the result rather than re-implementing the parser.
