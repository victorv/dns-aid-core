    Discover AI agents at a domain using DNS-AID protocol.

    Queries DNS for SVCB records under _agents.{domain} and returns discovered agent
    endpoints, optionally filtered by structured kwargs.

    Args:
        domain: Domain to search for agents (e.g., "example.com").
        protocol: Filter by protocol ("a2a", "mcp", or None for all).
        name: Filter by specific agent name (or None for all).
        require_dnssec: Require DNSSEC validation (raises if invalid). Per
            draft-02 §6.2 DNSSEC is MAY by default; consumers SHOULD set this
            to True for TLSA/DANE-bound deployments, where unsigned records
            cannot be trusted (RFC 6698 §10.1). SVCB-only deployments may
            leave this False.
        use_http_index: If True, fetch agent list from HTTP endpoint
            (``/.well-known/agents-index.json``) instead of DNS-only discovery.
        enrich_endpoints: If True (default), fetch ``.well-known/agent-card.json``
            from each discovered agent's host to resolve protocol-specific endpoint paths.
        verify_signatures: If True, verify JWS signatures. Implicit when ``require_signed``
            is set so the trust filter has data to act on. This is also the default
            trust anchor for an *off-domain* ARD catalog pointer: a pointer to a
            different registrable domain is followed when its catalog's records
            JWS-verify against the queried domain's JWKS (resolver-independent).
        trust_dnssec_pointers: Opt-in (default False). When True, an off-domain ARD
            catalog pointer (``_catalog._agents`` / ``_index._agents`` whose target
            is a different registrable domain) is also followed when the pointer
            record is DNSSEC-validated. Off by default because the AD flag is only
            trustworthy with a validating resolver over a secure path (localhost /
            DoT / DoH) and following it redirects discovery to a foreign host —
            enable only when you run such a resolver. On-domain pointers and JWS do
            not require this.
        verify_dane: Opt-in (default False). When True, each resolved agent's endpoint
            TLS certificate is checked against its DANE/TLSA record — defense-in-depth on
            the endpoint that does NOT change the catalog/pointer trust decision. A
            positive result is demoted to unknown unless the agent's DNS response was
            DNSSEC-validated (DANE without DNSSEC carries no integrity guarantee), so pair
            it with ``require_dnssec`` / ``min_dnssec`` for a meaningful result. Surfaced
            on ``AgentRecord.dane_verified``.
        capabilities: All-of capability match. Empty list explicitly matches no records.
        capabilities_any: Any-of capability match. Empty list explicitly matches no records.
        auth_type: Case-insensitive exact match against ``agent.auth_type``.
        intent: Match against ``agent.category``; substring fallback against capabilities.
        transport: For Path A this matches ``agent.protocol.value`` (DNS substrate does not
            surface the wire transport binding; use Path B for streamable-http / sse / etc.).
        realm: Exact match against ``agent.realm``.
        min_dnssec: When True, only records with DNSSEC-validated DNS responses pass.
        text_match: Case-insensitive substring across description, use_cases, capabilities.
        require_signed: Only records whose JWS signature verified pass. Auto-enables
            ``verify_signatures``.
        require_signature_algorithm: Restrict ``require_signed`` to records whose verified
            algorithm appears in this allow-list. Requires ``require_signed=True``.

    Returns:
        DiscoveryResult with the post-filter list of agents.

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``text_match`` is the empty string, or
            ``require_signature_algorithm`` is set without ``require_signed=True``.
