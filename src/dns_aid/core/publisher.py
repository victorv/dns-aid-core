    Publish an AI agent to DNS using DNS-AID protocol.

    Creates SVCB and TXT records that allow other agents to discover
    this agent via DNS queries.

    Args:
        name: Agent identifier (e.g., "chat", "network-specialist")
        domain: Domain to publish under (e.g., "example.com")
        protocol: Communication protocol ("a2a", "mcp", or Protocol enum)
        endpoint: Hostname where agent is reachable
        port: Port number (default: 443)
        capabilities: List of agent capabilities
        version: Agent version string
        description: Human-readable description
        use_cases: List of use cases for this agent
        category: Agent category (e.g., "network", "security")
        ttl: DNS record TTL in seconds
        backend: DNS backend to use (defaults to global backend)
        cap_uri: URI, URN, or compact JSON-Ref locator for the capability
            descriptor (DNS-AID draft-02 'cap' SvcParamKey)
        cap_sha256: Base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the capability descriptor
            (DNS-AID draft-02 'cap-sha256' SvcParamKey)
        well_known_path: RFC 8615 well-known path suffix (e.g., 'agent-card.json')
            for the DNS-AID draft-02 'well-known' SvcParamKey. Independent of
            cap_uri; both may be set. Consumers prefer cap_uri when both are
            present and fall back to reconstructing
            https://<svcb-target>/.well-known/<well_known_path>.
        bap: Optional single versioned agent-protocol identifier (e.g. "mcp=2.1",
            "a2a=1.0") for the Bulk Agent Protocol SvcParamKey. Experimental per
            draft-02 §FutureWork; alpn remains the canonical protocol carrier.
            Multi-protocol agents publish multiple AgentRecord instances at the
            same flat owner name, each with its own alpn and (optionally) bap —
            NOT as a comma-separated list on a single record.
        policy_uri: URI to agent policy document
        realm: Multi-tenant scope identifier (e.g., "production")
        connect_class: Connection mediation class (e.g., "direct", "lattice", "apphub-psc")
        connect_meta: Provider-specific connection metadata (e.g., service ARN)
        enroll_uri: Managed enrollment endpoint required before direct connection
        ipv4_hint: IPv4 address hints for SVCB record (RFC 9460 key 4)
        ipv6_hint: IPv6 address hints for SVCB record (RFC 9460 key 6)
        sign: If True, sign the record with JWS (requires private_key_path)
        private_key_path: Path to EC P-256 private key PEM file for signing
        allow_underscore_target: If True, downgrade a TargetName-contains-
            underscore violation from an error to a warning. Per
            draft-mozleywilliams-dnsop-dnsaid-02 §3.2 (Known Organization, Unknown Agent), SVCB
            TargetNames reached over TLS with publicly-issued x.509 certs
            MUST NOT contain underscores. dns-aid-core enforces this by
            default; set this flag for internal-only deployments where the
            target is not behind public PKI.
        publish_walkable_alias: When True, additionally write the
            optional walkable AliasMode SVCB record at
            ``{name}._agents.{domain}`` pointing at the flat primary
            owner. Per draft-02 §3.1 this record is operator-optional.
            **Default False**: the walkable record is an enumeration
            handle — a crawler that knows the zone can walk
            ``_agents.<zone>`` and inventory every agent the operator
            publishes. For most deployments that's undesirable (see
            ``docs/privacy-considerations.md``). Set True when you
            actively want the agents discoverable by enumeration —
            internal directories, intentional public catalogs, or
            DNS-SD-style consumers.
