# ARD ai-catalog discovery

DNS-AID interoperates with [ARD (Agentic Resource Discovery)](https://agenticresourcediscovery.org/spec/):
a domain can publish its agents as an **ARD ai-catalog**, advertise *where* that
catalog lives in DNS, and DNS-AID discovers the agents — dereferencing each one
to its real service endpoint. ARD is the search/index layer; DNS-AID is the
authoritative-discovery + identity substrate underneath it (the ARD spec §6.1
names DNS SVCB for catalog discovery, and §7.2.1 names DNS-AID for authoritative
registries).

This is **fully opt-in and non-breaking**. A domain that publishes nothing new
behaves exactly as before; pure-DNS discovery never touches any of this.

## Discovery order of operations

`discover(domain, use_http_index=True)` resolves agents in this order. Pure DNS
discovery (`use_http_index=False`, the default) is a separate path that ignores
the catalog entirely.

    A["discover(domain, use_http_index=True)"] --> B{"DNS pointer?<br/>_catalog._agents / _index._agents SVCB"}
    B -- "resolves (host-anywhere)" --> C["fetch catalog at the pointer's host<br/>(SSRF-checked, redirects refused)"]
    B -- "no pointer" --> D["probe well-known patterns in order:<br/>legacy index endpoints, then<br/>/.well-known/ai-catalog.json"]
    C --> E["parse catalog → entries"]
    D --> E
    E --> F["for each agent entry"]
    F --> G{"authoritative DNS<br/>SVCB record?"}
    G -- "yes" --> H["DNS record WINS<br/>catalog enriches it"]
    G -- "no" --> I["fetch the entry's card<br/>(A2A / MCP, SSRF-checked, no redirects)"]
    I --> J["apply REAL endpoint + skills/tools + auth<br/>endpoint_source = ard_card"]
    H --> K["AgentRecord"]
    J --> K
```

Key invariants:

- **DNS is authoritative per agent.** If a catalog agent also has a real DNS
  SVCB record, that record wins and the catalog only enriches it (Step G→H).
- **The pointer is authoritative for *location*.** Publishing a `_catalog._agents`
  / `_index._agents` SVCB tells discovery where the catalog is; without one,
  discovery falls back to the well-known path on the domain itself.
- **Nothing is fetched from a parse path.** URL-referenced nested catalogs are
  never followed; only agent cards are fetched, and only through the
  SSRF-validated, size-capped, redirect-refusing fetcher.

## Publishing the pointer (host-anywhere)

The catalog can live anywhere — the SVCB target is just a hostname:

```bash
# Dual-label by default: _catalog._agents (ARD) + _index._agents (DNS-AID)
dns-aid index publish-catalog example.com catalogue.example.com

# ARD label only (don't touch the DNS-AID org-index pointer)
dns-aid index publish-catalog example.com catalogue.example.com --catalog-only

# Fixed-IP origin: add RFC 9460 address hints (OMIT for CDN-fronted hosts)
dns-aid index publish-catalog example.com catalogue.example.com --ipv4-hint 203.0.113.10
```

produces:

```dns
_catalog._agents.example.com.  SVCB 1 catalogue.example.com. alpn="h2" port="443"
_index._agents.example.com.    SVCB 1 catalogue.example.com. alpn="h2" port="443"
```

The target host carries the public TLS cert and can hold a DANE/TLSA record
(draft-02 §Known Organization). Any host works — a dedicated box, CloudFront,
an S3 REST endpoint, or a partner-hosted origin — as long as it serves the
catalog over HTTPS at `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`.

Library and MCP equivalents: `dns_aid.core.catalog_pointer.publish_catalog_pointer(...)`
and the MCP `publish_catalog_pointer` tool.

#### Removing a catalog pointer

The inverse operation removes the pointer SVCB records — available on all three
interfaces, and idempotent (missing records are a no-op):

```bash
# Remove both _catalog._agents and _index._agents SVCB records
dns-aid index unpublish-catalog example.com

# Remove only the ARD _catalog._agents label (leave _index._agents in place)
dns-aid index unpublish-catalog example.com --catalog-only
```

Only the SVCB pointer is deleted — any TXT at `_index._agents` (a DNS-AID
org-index listing) is left intact. Library and MCP equivalents:
`dns_aid.core.catalog_pointer.unpublish_catalog_pointer(...)` and the MCP
`unpublish_catalog_pointer` tool.

### Compatibility

- **Pure-DNS discovery is untouched.** Publishing a pointer only affects
  `use_http_index=True` discovery.
- **`_index._agents` is protected.** If the domain already has an `_index._agents`
  SVCB pointing at a different host, publish preserves it and warns; pass
  `--force-index` to replace it, or `--catalog-only` to skip it.

## What discovery returns

For an ARD agent resolved from catalog data, the agent's card is fetched and
dereferenced, so you get the **real** service endpoint and the card's
skills/tools — not the catalog's card URL:

```bash
dns-aid discover example.com --use-http-index --json
```

```jsonc
{
  "name": "billing",
  "protocol": "mcp",
  "endpoint": "https://billing.example.com",   // real endpoint from the card
  "endpoint_source": "ard_card",
  "capabilities": ["create_invoice", "list_payments"],
  "capability_source": "agent_card",
  "trust_manifest": { "identity": "spiffe://example.com/agents/billing", "...": "..." }
}
```

## Trust

An ARD entry's `trustManifest` (publisher identity, SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / GDPR
attestations, provenance, signature) is preserved on `AgentRecord.trust_manifest`
as **pass-through published claims** — DNS-AID does not verify signatures,
digests, or identity in this release. Two warning-only signals flag possible
impersonation: `ard_trust_identity_mismatch` (identity domain ≠ URN publisher)
and `ard_trust_foreign_publisher` (URN publisher ≠ the domain that served the
catalog over TLS). Cryptographic verification anchored in DNSSEC/DANE is future
work.
